### ***🌟 About Aegis***

***Aegis is an enterprise IT-support copilot built on an agentic RAG workflow. It answers questions from your company's private knowledge base first, and reaches out to the external web only when the internal evidence is weak.***

***The system uses a **LangGraph** workflow that routes the question, retrieves private documents, grades the evidence, falls back to web search when needed, rewrites and retries weak queries, and finally produces a grounded answer, while showing every decision live in an Agent Trace panel.***

| Step | Node | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Route question** | Decide whether the question needs private KB, web, or both |
| 2 | **Retrieve private KB** | Fetch relevant chunks from company documents |
| 3 | **Grade evidence** | Check whether retrieved context actually answers the question |
| 4 | **Web fallback** | Search the external web only if evidence is weak |
| 5 | **Rewrite & retry** | Reformulate the query and try retrieval again |
| 6 | **Grounded answer** | Generate the final answer using only the gathered evidence |

***Unlike a basic RAG chatbot, Aegis does not blindly answer from whatever it retrieves. It evaluates its own evidence and chooses the next action, which is what makes it **agentic**.***

---

### ***💡 Example Questions***

- *How do I connect to the company VPN?*
- *What is our password reset policy?*
- *What is the latest Microsoft Teams outage guidance?* ← requires current external vendor information, so the web fallback may trigger

---

### ***🧩 Tech Stack***

### ***AI & Agents***

- **LangGraph** (agentic workflow orchestration)
- **RAG** (retrieval over private company documents)
- **LLM** for evidence grading, query rewriting and answer generation
- **Web search** fallback for current external information

### ***Application***

- **Python 3.11**
- **API layer** (`agent/api`)
- **Custom dark-theme frontend** (`ui/`)

### ***Deployment***

- **Docker**
- **Render**

### ***⚙️ Getting Started***

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Aegis.git
cd Aegis

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env            # PowerShell: Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Add GROQ_API_KEY, TAVILY_API_KEY, PINECONE_API_KEY, and a unique ADMIN_API_KEY

# 5. Ingest the sample knowledge base
python ingest_sample_knowledge.py

# 6. Run the application
uvicorn agent.main:app --reload
```

### ***🐳 Run with Docker***

```bash
docker build -t aegis .
docker run -p 8000:8080 --env-file .env aegis
```

The container listens on port `8080`; the command above exposes it locally at
`http://localhost:8000`. Keep `.env` private. The embedding model must match
the configured Pinecone index dimension; the default MiniLM model produces
384-dimensional vectors.

---

### ***🧪 Why Grounded Answers Matter***

Aegis is designed to reduce hallucination in enterprise support:

```text
Private KB Evidence Found?
          ↓
Evidence Good Enough?
          ↓
   YES → Answer from private documents
   NO  → Search web → Rewrite → Retry
          ↓
Answer only from gathered evidence
```

This keeps internal policy answers tied to company documents and uses the web only for questions that genuinely need current external information.

---

### ***⚠️ Limitations***

- Answer quality depends on the quality and coverage of the ingested documents.
- Web fallback results depend on external search availability and source quality.
- Free-tier hosting may have cold starts and non-persistent disk storage.
- LLM and search services require network access and valid API keys.
- Responses should be verified for critical security or compliance decisions.

---

### ***🔮 Future Enhancements***

- Source citations with document links in every answer
- Document-level access control and multi-tenant knowledge bases
- Conversation memory across sessions
- Admin dashboard for document management
- Evaluation suite for retrieval and answer quality
- Slack / Microsoft Teams integration
- Ticket creation for unresolved issues

### ***🎯 Real-World Use Cases***

✔ Internal IT Helpdesk Assistant

✔ Employee Self-Service Support

✔ Company Policy Q&A

✔ Enterprise Knowledge Search

✔ Agentic RAG Demonstration

✔ AI/ML Portfolio Project

## ***💼 Why This Project Is Valuable for an AI Engineer Portfolio***

Aegis demonstrates an end-to-end agentic AI application rather than only a standalone model.
